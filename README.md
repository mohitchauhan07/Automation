Web Automation and Web Scrapping

Here, I have used an automation on practo website , which is known for its excellence in providing
consultaion and appointment to the doctors, clinic, hospitals, etc.
Currently they have registered almost all authorised doctors on their website, so one can book an online
call or appointment for that doctor.

This program will let you know the best doctor based on your problem listed on their website in your local
area.

This will give you a brief and refined result of doctor based on their classifications like
1. Year of Experience 
2. Consultaion fee
3. Relevance
4. Recommendation

Using this automation one can use simple lines to get a fined report and description of doctor/clinic with their
consultaion fee, timing , designation, etc.

eg. "dentist" "year of experience".
this line will search the tuned doctor of specialization of "dentist" and based on their year of experience in 
their field.

similarly 

eg. "neurologist" "consultaion fees"
    "dermetolist" "relevance"
    "ayurveda" "recommendation"

1. Puppeeter
2. Node js
